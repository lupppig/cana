# Cana üåø

**Cana** is an HTTP server written from scratch in Go  without relying on Go‚Äôs built-in `net/http` package.

The goal isn‚Äôt to build the next revolutionary Go framework or compete with the likes of Gin, Echo, or Fiber. Instead, **Cana** is my personal sandbox  a place to break things, rebuild them, and deepen my understanding of Go‚Äôs internals, networking, and how web servers actually work under the hood.

Think of it less like a product, more like a journey.

## Why the Name?

‚ÄúCana‚Äù is short for *cannabis*. No, it won‚Äôt roll your joints for you üòÖ  but just like a good session, this project is here to chill, experiment, and spark new ideas. I guess I just love my weed‚Ä¶ LOL.

---

## Project Goals

* Build an HTTP server without `net/http`.
* Understand TCP socket programming in Go.
* Experiment with routing, request handling, and middleware.
* Create a playground where I can grow as a Go developer.

---

## What Cana Can (Eventually) Do

* Accept and respond to HTTP requests.
* Basic routing (e.g. matching paths to handlers).
* Return JSON and plain text responses.
* Handle simple middleware.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Still early days! This is more of a ‚Äúlearn in public‚Äù experiment than a polished framework.

## Inspirations

Projects like Gin, Fiber, and Echo ‚Äî but stripped down to the bare metal.

## Disclaimer

This project isn‚Äôt production-ready (and probably never will be). The main goal is learning, experimenting, and having fun. If you want something battle-tested, check out [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/).
